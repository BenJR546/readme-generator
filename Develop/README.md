## Installation
This project uses the "Inquirer v8.2.6" dependency to function. To install this, and run the code, NodeJS must also be installed locally. Make sure to use "npm install" to install the dependencies before you run the code.

## Usage
Navigate to the directory using terminal, and input "node index" or "node index.js". You will be prompted with questions to fill out the README, all of which are typed with the exception of Licensing, which is presented as a series of choices. Use the arrow keys to navigate the options and press enter to submit your choice, upon which the README.md file will be generated and saved to the directory selected in the terminal.
